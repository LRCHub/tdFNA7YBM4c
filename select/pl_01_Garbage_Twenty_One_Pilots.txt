One, two
I feel like garbage
I feel like
My systems are operating at
twenty percent
Or less
I'll walk you through the numbers
I'll show you nothing's left
Oh-oh
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm biting down on my shirtsleeve
(Yeah, yeah)
I'll lash out
if you're in arm's reach
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm so lost,
like "What is happening?"
Like, like
I feel like garbage
Ooh, yeah
I can't decide
If I could feel more
or I just knew less
When I was younger
Bright-eyed with wonder
Do you know which name it's under?
(Oh-oh-oh)
Or less
I'll walk you through the numbers
I'll show you nothing's left
Oh-oh
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm biting down on my shirtsleeve
(Yeah, yeah)
I'll lash out
if you're in arm's reach
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm so lost,
like "What is happening?"
Like, "What is happening?"
Would you move closer
if I grew quieter?
Maybe this is you
Maybe you don't fix
and you like it like this
I feel like garbage
(Yeah)
I feel like garbage
I feel like
(Yeah)
Like
I'll lash out, lash out, lash out
(Hey)
I'm biting down on my shirtsleeve
Like,
I'll lash out, lash out, lash out
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
No, no, no,
please, please, please
