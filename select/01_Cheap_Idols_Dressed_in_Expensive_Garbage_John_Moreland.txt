Brother come out of your slumber
Before the devil knows your number
Passing down our grief and illness
Plastic flowers, plastic business

Cheap idols dressed in expensive garbage
Cheap idols dressed in expensive garbage
We can't afford the deal we bargained
Cheap idols dressed in expensive garbage

The bright blue night will surely shake us
The stars will write the songs that save us
Our pitter patter is the rain
The trees will not recall my name

Cheap idols dressed in expensive garbage
Cheap idols dressed in expensive garbage

There's a monument that bears your name
To remind you of your fragile fame
To remind you of the choice you made
To spin your wheels into the grave

Cheap idols dressed in expensive garbage
Cheap idols dressed in expensive garbage
We can't afford the deal we bargained
Cheap idols dressed in expensive garbage
