I can't seem to make you mine
Kissin' all around all the time
Flyin' around like a bee
Hurtin' everything you see

Tried everything I know, oh
To make you want to love me so, oh
The only thing you do, oh
Is try to put the hurt on me, oh

Can't you see what you're doin' to me?
You fill my heart with misery
With every breath, every step I take
I'm more in love with you, oh

I can't go on like this
A little bit of love, and not a kiss
I gotta have your love every day
One that is real and will stay, oh

Can't you see
What you're doin' to me?
You fill my heart with misery
With every breath, every step I take
I'm more in love with you, oh

I can't seem to make you mine, oh
I can't seem to make you mine, oh
Kissin' all around all the time
I can't seem to make you mine, oh
Flyin' around like a bee
Hurtin' everything you see
I can't seem to make you mine, oh
Can't seem to make you mine, oh
I can't seem to make you mine
Can't seem to make you mine
